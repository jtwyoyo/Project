To run the whole program
1.) run the database provided in folder "MainWebsite-phase1,2"
2.) cd to "MainWebsite-phase1,2" and use command npm start
3.) cd to "AdminDashboard-phase3" and use command npm start

***Please note that: The Admin Dashboard login page doesn't work as intended, so we modified it so that
it can login to website without any username or password needed. The userslist and movieslist page
sometimes doesn't show a list of users or movies. This can be fixed by clicking home on sidebar and simply 
click onto the users or movies on the sidebar once more. Sometimes, it takes multiple clicks to get the website to show the lists.
We're very sorry for any inconvenience user may experience. ;-;
