WebProgramming-Project
A project constructed by a group of students at Mahidol University to simulate a functional movie website.

Members:
1. Yo
2. Fifa
3. Heartties
4. Hiyou

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Handlebars

Goal:
1. Design a website and add a reasonable amount of content.
2. Use MySQL to create database.
3. Implement search function onto website.
4. Uses of existed APIs
5. Design Admin Page for handling content of the site.

To run the whole program
1. run the database provided in folder "MainWebsite-phase1,2"
2. cd to "MainWebsite-phase1,2" and use command npm start
3. cd to "AdminDashboard-phase3" and use command npm start

***Please note that: The Admin Dashboard login page doesn't work as intended, so we modified it so that it can login to website without any username or password needed. The userslist and movieslist page sometimes doesn't show a list of users or movies. This can be fixed by clicking home on sidebar and simply click onto the users or movies on the sidebar once more. Sometimes, it takes multiple clicks to get the website to show the lists. We're very sorry for any inconvenience user may experience.
